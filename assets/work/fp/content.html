<h3>Angular 2 Application Development &amp; Consulting</h3>
<p>I was asked to assist the FP internal team in constructing a JavaScript application to deliver their annual Global Thinkers Index. The internal team wanted to explore some future-forward frameworks, so we landed on Angular 2 on this project for ease of scaffolding (the CLI) and reasonable documentation and support.</p>

<p>Additionally, we knew that if we ran into a real bind, we could always bounce questions off the gracious <a href="http://ultimateangular.com" target="_blank">Todd Motto</a>.</p>

<p>My role was to help establish the architecture for the application and develop most major functionality.</p>
