<h2>Pendo</h2>
<h3>Website Build &amp; CMS Integration</h3>
<p>I was called in mid-project to assist with a rebranding effort at Pendo. Their internal team had done most of the heavy lifting to establish style, components, and architecture.</p>

<p>My role was to help get the project ready to launch, and to collaborate with the Pendo team to finalize the last bits of javascript animation and responsive styling.</p>

<p>Additionally, I ported their design to the blog, which is hosted in a separate Wordpress environment.</p>
