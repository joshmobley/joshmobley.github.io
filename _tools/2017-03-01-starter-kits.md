These starter kits use JS modules. They come out of the box with require.js to power browser compatibility. For more information, [read my post about RequireJS]({{ site.url }}/writing/2016/12/21/simple-javascript-modules-with-require-js.html).

Unless noted, Gulp is used as the task runner. All repos are hosted on [github](https://github.com/joshmobley). PR's and issues welcome.
