I approach my work through multiple lenses. Starting my career as a UX Designer, I have a heart and passion for building experience that are intuitive and easy to use. Constantly using data and human-interaction to determine what works well for people is paramount.

Additionally, I always consider the technical implications of possible design solutions early, to ensure I'm building an extensible, maintainable system that can scale.
