As I look ahead to 2017, one of the big changes I intend to make is to be more intentional about documenting things that I learn in my day-to-day work and exploration. 

I've never been a great blogger. Always well-intentioned, but never consistant. For a long time I've felt the "resistance" that most people feel. "Someone else has already written about this." or "I'm not an expert on this technology yet."

Those things are often true, but should have no bearing on me simply documenting the problems that I'm solving on a day-to-day basis.

So this, my newly-launched website, will be my home in 2017 to continue to learn, share, and connect with you about the things I'm doing both big and small. I'm making a commitment to create more content that hopefully will be a valuable time-saver for someone who comes behind me.

I look forward to seeing you at a conference, on twitter, and hopefully as a regular reader here.
