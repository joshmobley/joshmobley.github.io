I was asked to assist the Foreign Policy internal team in constructing a JavaScript application to deliver their annual Global Thinkers Index. The internal team wanted to explore some future-forward frameworks, so we landed on Angular 2 on this project for ease of scaffolding (the CLI) and reasonable documentation and support.

My role was to help establish the architecture for the application and develop most major functionality.
