I was called in mid-project to assist with a rebranding effort at Pendo. Their internal team had done most of the heavy lifting to establish style, components, and architecture.

My role was to help get the project ready to launch, and to collaborate with the Pendo team to finalize the last bits of javascript animation and responsive styling.

Additionally, I ported their design to the blog, which is hosted in a separate Wordpress environment.
