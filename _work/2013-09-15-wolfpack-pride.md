<div class="content">

<p>While in-seat at <a href="http://ncsu.edu" target="blank">NC State</a>, I was one of two developers in the University Communications unit of the university.</p>

<p>Our unit was responsible for creating and building the brand standards and properties for NC State. Additionally, we assisted many individual colleges and departments with digital and brand strategy as well, to ensure a unified application of messaging and standards across campus.</p>

<p>My role was to assist in all development work for various university- and college-level digital properties including migrating to Wordpress, building and improving existing sites to include responsive development techniques, as well as aiding in UX and IA strategy.</p>
