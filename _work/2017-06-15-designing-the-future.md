<div class="content">

<p>I was asked to help the Hopscotch Design team with building out a completely rethought digital presence for their 2017 iteration of the event. In addition to the site, they needed a custom schedule created that could be updated on the fly.</p>

<p>My role was to help envision the final product in collaboration with Marie Schacht and Chris Sim, and to deliver on the technical execution of the project.</p>
