<div class="content">

<p>While in-seat at <a href="http://newkind.com" target="blank">New Kind</a>, I was the primary developer of Cameron Village's new website.</p>

<p>My role was to help with any technical strategy and to construct the site from the ground up. This project required a couple of pieces of unique functionality, including a robust events calendar, cross-pollinating and tagging multiple custom post types, and a custom google map.</p>

<p>As with all CMS customizations, special attention was given to create a  pleasant and simple experience for content producers to manage their various types of content.</p>

<p>For a full review of the project, please check out <a href="http://newkind.com/the-work/cameron-village" target="blank">New Kind's Case Study</a>. </p>
